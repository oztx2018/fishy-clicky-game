# fishy-clicky-game

This is a simple memory challenge game written in React
Don't click the same card twice!

Memory game build using React JS library. Components state is managed to respond to user events.

The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.
The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented on clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
